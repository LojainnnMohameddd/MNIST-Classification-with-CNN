# MNIST-Classification-with-CNN
MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The goal is to build and train a model that can accurately recognize and categorize images of the digits 0 through 9.

Project Overview
The project follows a standard machine learning workflow, which includes:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: Loading the MNIST dataset and preparing the images for the neural network by normalizing and reshaping them.

Model Architecture: Designing a CNN model with convolutional, pooling, and dense layers to learn features from the images.

Model Training: Training the model on the training dataset to optimize its performance.

Model Evaluation: Evaluating the trained model's accuracy on a separate test dataset.

Prediction: Using the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen handwritten digit images.

Technologies Used
The project is built using the following key libraries:

TensorFlow/Keras: The primary framework for building and training the neural network.

NumPy: For numerical operations and data handling.

Matplotlib: For visualizing data, such as plotting images and training history.

Seaborn: For creating more informative and aesthetically pleasing plots.
